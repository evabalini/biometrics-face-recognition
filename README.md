# biometrics-face-recognition
Contains code for the third assignment for the course of Biometrics System Concepts on the topic of face recognition. 

Four face recognition systems based on Principal Component Analysis (Eigenfaces), Linear Discriminant Analysis (Fisherfaces), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) 
and deep learning were implemented, tested, and evaluated.
The datasets used were the Caltech dataset, Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and AT&T (Olivetti faces).
